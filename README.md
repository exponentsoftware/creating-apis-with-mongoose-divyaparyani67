Creating APIs with Mongoose - Backend Assignment

# Introduction

Express is one of the most popular web frameworks for Node.js that supports routing, middleware, view system… Mongoose is a promise-based Node.js ODM for MongoDB that provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model our application data along with built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks… In this tutorial, I will show you step by step to build Node.js Restful API for CRUD operations using Express, Mongoose with MongoDB database.

You should install MongoDB in your machine first. The installation instructions can be found at [Official MongoDB installation manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/).
